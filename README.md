# Fireworks!

This is my crazy hackable [fireworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKeyIbT3vXI&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain) implementation in C++.

I've been tempted into making it by some folks on Discord, and decided to pimp it as much as I can think about.

It uses [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) for graphics and audio, [PCG](http://www.pcg-random.org/) for pseudorandomness (optionally), and [PLF](http://plflib.org/index.htm) list implementation (optionally). Generates colours randomly, has semi realistic gravity physics, has explosion sounds generated by [rFXGen](https://raysan5.itch.io/rfxgen), and nearly every number in it is customizable in one config file. (Mind that too many particles are not good for your GPU. ;) )

I also hacked in C++17 style emplace_back and emplace_front into the PLF list for this to work as intended. :)

Look into [Design Document](doc/design_document.md) for some more talk and phases of development.
